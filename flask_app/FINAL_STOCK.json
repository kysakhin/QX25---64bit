perfection at the start of the year trading at a rare premium to its fair value . he advised investors at the start of the year to overweight value stocks which were attractively priced while underweighting growth stocks that were significantly overvalued . this advice proved prescient as the morningstar us market index fell by .% through march with losses concentrated in growth and core stocks . this was particularly true for stocks linked to artificial intelligence which dropped by .% and .% respectively . in contrast value stocks gained .% showcasing their resilience . sekera noted that as of march the us equity market had declined to a price fair value ratio of . representing a % discount to morningstar s fair value estimates . moreover growth stocks experienced a sharp correction reducing their premium from % at the start of the year to just % . on the other hand despite their recent gains value stocks became even more undervalued trading at a % discount to fair value . he emphasizes that this has made value stocks the most attractive investment category for the year . his outlook also addresses market dynamics by capitalization . he recommends overweighting small cap stocks due to their significant undervaluation at an % discount to fair value . however he cautions that small cap performance might not materialize until later in the year when economic conditions improve and monetary policy becomes more accommodative . conversely large cap and mid cap stocks are less appealing as they are trading at similar discounts to the overall market . moreover monetary policy plays a central role in sekera s analysis . morningstar s economics team forecasts three federal funds rate cuts in and anticipates a gradual economic rebound starting in early . while long term interest rates are expected to remain stable initially they are projected to enter a multiyear downward trend later in . he also addressed misconceptions about market sell offs being driven by tariffs . instead he attributed much of the downturn to a concentrated sell off in ai related stocks . according to morningstar s analysis losses from just ten highly ai correlated stocks outweighed overall market declines with seven of these being among the top performing stocks in . to curate the list of high growth non tech stocks that are profitable in we used the finviz stock

      "we recently compiled a list of the best emerging markets stocks to buy according to hedge funds . in this article we are going to take a look at where icici bank limited nyse ibn stands against the other emerging markets stocks . emerging markets stocks are shares of companies based in developing countries think brazil india china or south africa that are rapidly industrializing and growing their economies . unlike the familiar and more predictable world of us stocks emerging markets offer something quite different higher growth potential coupled with greater volatility influenced by unique local dynamics such as political shifts currency swings and evolving regulations . why venture into these turbulent waters because with higher risk comes the potential for higher rewards . these markets often grow faster than mature economies making them especially attractive if you re looking to diversify beyond the stability and sometimes slower pace of us equities . also exposure to the best emerging markets stocks would not only boost the return profile of a portfolio but also make it less volatile through diversification many emerging markets exhibit little to no sensitivity to the state of the economy in the us meaning that their national economy could continue to grow even when the us is in a recession . read also best emerging technology stocks to buy now timing matters especially when diving into emerging markets stocks . investing in these companies makes the most sense when global economic conditions are improving investor sentiment is optimistic and local political or financial uncertainties are settling down . it s particularly appealing if you re a patient investor who can withstand short term volatility for potentially bigger long term gains . additionally when valuations in developed markets like the us are stretched and growth appears limited emerging markets stocks can offer a refreshing alternative giving your portfolio both growth exposure and geographical diversification . the current tendencies we see in the global markets are highly suggestive that a potential rotation from us stocks to emerging markets stocks would be the right move to make . despite the us market being in correction mode valuations still appear stretched as the whole market trades at a forward p e above x significantly above the historical average which is around the mid teens . this is the first factor that points toward the possibility that us stock market returns will be lower until the end of the decade due to the impact of declining valuations or call it a return to more normal valuations . second the new trump . administration introduced a lot of noise into the us economy the atlanta fed has already lowered its gdp growth estimates for the following quarters as a result of significant cuts in public spending as well as the tariff threats negatively impacting the private spending outlook . this expected economic slowdown is exclusive to the us market while emerging markets may continue to grow their economies at a usual pace . finally the potential impact of the upcoming reciprocal tariffs on april is still not completely understood by the markets . what is certain is that the tariff threats have already caused inflation in some products such as construction materials copper and other commodities as businesses rushed to stockpile raw materials and inventories at cheaper prices before tariffs were enforced . higher inflation especially in core products like housing is not good for the economy as it pressures consumers and erodes their spending power . higher inflation may also reduce the chances that the fed will lower interest rates any time soon which is another impediment to economic growth . the key takeaway for readers is that the aforementioned headwinds and threats are mostly exclusive to the us market while most of the emerging markets are likely to be impacted much less . a businessperson looking out a city skyline from the top floor of a high rise building . we shortlisted - emerging markets stocks that are based in and derive most of their revenue from emerging countries . then we compared the list with our proprietary database of hedge funds ownership and included in the article the top stocks with the largest number of hedge funds owning the stock as of q . all stocks are ranked in ascending order . why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds . our quarterly newsletter s strategy selects small cap and large cap stocks every quarter and has returned .% since may beating its benchmark by percentage points see more details here . number of hedge fund holders icici bank limited nyse ibn is a leading private sector bank in india headquartered in mumbai . the bank offers a comprehensive range of financial products and services including retail and corporate banking investment banking insurance and asset management . with a network of over branches and atms across india ibn serves a vast customer base . the bank has expanded internationally establishing subsidiaries in the uk and canada and branches in countries such as the us singapore and hong kong . the bank s primary operations and revenue streams are deeply rooted in the indian market providing significant exposure to the emerging market sector . icici bank limited nyse ibn demonstrated strong financial performance with profit before tax excluding treasury growing by .% yoy . the bank s core operating profit increased by .% yoy to . billion rupees while profit after tax grew by .% yoy to . billion rupees . total deposits showed a healthy growth of .% yoy with the domestic loan portfolio expanding by .% yoy . the bank maintained strong asset quality with a net npa ratio of .% and held substantial contingency provisions of . billion rupees representing about .% of total loans . the capital position of icici bank limited nyse ibn remained robust with a cet- ratio of .% and a total capital adequacy ratio of .% . the bank continues to focus on risk calibrated profitable growth through its -degree customer centric approach while maintaining high standards of governance and enhancing delivery capabilities . ibn is on our list of the best emerging markets stocks because it delivers attractive growth across several emerging countries and even managed to outperform the world stock market index in the last years . overall ibn ranks th on our list of the best emerging markets stocks to buy according to hedge funds . while we acknowledge the potential of ibn as an investment our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame . if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than ibn but that trades at less than times its earnings check out our report about the cheapest ai stock . read next best ai stocks to buy now and best stocks to buy now according to billionaires . disclosure none . this article is originally published at insider monkey .",
      "as the end of the tax year approaches experts say it could be worth reviewing the investments in your individual savings account isa to make the most of your annual allowance . this tax year ends on april meaning the maximum annual allowance of that you can put into an isa will reset the day after . that means investors still have a little time left to use any of remaining allowance by topping up this tax free savings pot . hal cook senior investment analyst at hargreaves lansdown hl .l said this is a great time to review your isa investments . you might still have some of your isa allowance left . if so then perhaps you could consider using it to make your isa more diversified . he explained that funds can be good way to diversify your investments but that it s important to make sure they are truly different . read more stocks that are trending today the problem is that determining exactly how diversified your portfolio is not always as easy as you might think he said . for example an investor could buy a global fund a us fund and a technology fund where there could be more overlap in these funds than it seems . the msci world index -usd strd currently has a % exposure to the us while this goes up to % for the msci world information technology index . in addition the msci world and msci usa -usd strd indices have % and % exposure to the technology sector respectively . all three of these indices also have the same top three investments apple aapl nvidia nvda and microsoft msft . so although you are buying three seemingly quite distinct funds in reality there is a big overlap in the underlying holdings cook said . the important thing for all investors is to understand exactly what they own whether they have a concentrated portfolio or not and if they do that they are happy with the risks that poses he said . myron jobson senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor noted that this season had been marked by volatility fuelled partly by us president donald trump s trade war . but investors should not be swayed by short term turbulence he said . investing is a long term endeavour and history shows that those who remain patient and stay the course tend to be rewarded . time in the market is what truly counts . with that in mind analysts suggest the following funds could help with diversification depending on what investors are looking to add to their isa portfolio . for investors looking to add exposure outside the us market the liontrust european dynamic ptqm .l fund is one suggestion from jason hollands managing director at investment platform bestinvest . europe was hard hit by the pandemic and its manufacturing sector has struggled since but the massive increases in defence and infrastructure spending should act as a form of stimulus he said . read more how chip firms have fared since trump s inauguration from nvidia to intel this fund screens for companies on attractive valuations with very strong free cash generation hollands explained . from this watched list the managers then choose companies that either exhibit strong momentum high cash returns offer recovery value and or where there is a contrarian opportunity . the fund currently has overweight positions in the financial sector consumer discretionary stocks and industrials . top holdings include italian bank unicredit ucg .mi jewellery brand pandora pndora .co and french construction materials group saint gobain sgo .pa . while the fund has generated a return of just .% over the past year it has returned % over five years . another option for gaining exposure to europe put forward by wealth club investment manager isaac stell is ws lightman european . the fund is managed by industry veteran rob burnett who set up lightman investment management in which specialises european equities . despite being a relatively young fund lightman european has generated a return of nearly % over five years . top positions include oil majors shell shel .l and equinor eqnr .ol as well as telecoms companies orange ora .pa and telef nica tef .mc . read more bank of england poised to hold uk interest rates amid trump trade war the lightman european fund looks for businesses that have been through challenging periods but where the light at the end of the tunnel is in sight and earnings growth is returning said stell . lightman focuses on those investment characteristics that have historically led to the most consistent returns over the longest timeframes namely lowly valued companies with strong balance sheets and high free cashflows . he said that with european stocks looking cheap compared to us peers and signs that investors are pulling capital back out of the us and looking at europe lightman s european fund could well benefit and continue its strong run of performance . stell also put forward the dodge cox us stock pqd .l fund which has delivered a return of .% over one year and % over five years . the fund has relatively little exposure to tech companies with the sector accounting for less than % over its investments compared with the % that it accounts for in the s p gspc index . with the shine seemingly coming off tech stocks it may be a good time to diversify into the more overlooked parts of the us market said stell . the dodge cox us stock fund could be a great starting point . the fund s three top holdings are financial services firm charles schwab schw and financial technology company fiserv fi as well as insurer metlife met . for exposure to emerging markets tom bigley fund analyst at interactive investor highlighted the goldman sachs india equity portfolio fund . over the past decade the indian economy and stock market has seen substantial growth and is now one of the most highly valued markets in the world despite a pullback in recent months he said . india s nifty nsei is down % over the past six months with overseas investors pulling out of the market amid concerns around slowing economic growth and higher valuations . read more how to invest in the indian stock market while the goldman sachs fund has returned less than % over one year it is up nearly % over five years . the fund invests in sound businesses of all sizes preferring companies with strong competitive advantages and low or decreasing competition said bigley . company meetings are a crucial part of the process and the fund management team s ability to meet companies on the ground in india differentiates it from many competitors . top holdings include indian multinational bank icici bank ltd icicibank .ns and it firm infosys infosys infy .ns . bigley pointed out that not only has the fund outperformed the msci india imi index in four of the past five years it has also beaten this index and peers over five and years . for investors looking for more exposure to smaller and medium sized us companies hollands said that the bestinvest team liked the premier miton us opportunities fund . the managers look for companies with sustainable earnings growth he said . if the us administration does push ahead with deregulation and corporate tax cuts this should benefit these more domestically focused businesses . the fund is down nearly % over the past year but has returned nearly % over five years . its biggest sector exposure is % in industrials while technology accounts for just % of the portfolio . top holdings include financial services firm raymond james rjf and entertainment company live nation entertainment lyv . as for a sustainable fund pick bigley pointed to the janus henderson global sustainable equity phgj .l fund . sustainability is central to the process he said . for a company to be considered eligible at least % of their revenues is required to be aligned with the team s positive impact themes which are mapped to the un sustainable development goals . this results in a subset of companies with long term compounding characteristics and support from structural growth drivers . read more european stocks performing well amid us volatility while the top two holdings are microsoft msft and nvidia nvda other key positions include healthcare services company mckesson mck and energy management firm schneider electric su .pa . with its disciplined investment process and sustainability focus this fund could be a compelling choice for an investor seeking to expand the core global equity exposure in their portfolio . said bigley . the fund has produced a return of% over one year but has returned % over five years . one option that hargreaves lansdown s hl .l cook said could be of interest to investors is the bny multi asset balanced pxs .l fund which focuses on companies with solid long term prospects from around the world using bonds and cash to offer some diversification . the fund which has returned .% over one year and % over three years aims to achieve a balance between capital growth and income over the long term . while top holdings include microsoft msft and alphabet googl goog there are also key positions ftse ftse firms including business information giant relx rel .l and shell shel .l . most of the fund typically -% is invested in shares and fund manager simon nichols favours established companies with competitive advantages that often pay a dividend said cook . nichols likes companies that pay a dividend because of the discipline that this puts on company management teams . cook said that the schroder managed balanced pjwbz .l fund is a highly diversified option as it uses a funds of funds approach to investing . this refers to when managers mainly invest in other funds rather than individual shares or bonds which means the total number of securities in the portfolio is large and in this case stood at around as of the end of january . even though the fund is highly diversified it has a focus on shares which makes it higher risk than some peers cook said . because the fund is so diversified decisions around what regions and asset classes to invest in tend to have a bigger impact on performance than the individual choices around what companies to invest in he added . the managers have a lot of experience in running this fund and thinking about asset allocation though so we think they are a great option for long term investors . the fund has returned nearly % over one year but over five years generated a return of nearly % . another fund on cook s list is baillie gifford monthly income phcbd .l which aims to provide an income return that increases by more than the consumer prices index cpi a key measure of inflation over time . the fund has generated a return of % over one year which is ahead of january s uk cpi reading of % . over a long term horizon the fund has produced a much stronger return of % over five years . the top position in the fund as of the end of february was a uk treasury bill which is a government bond with a short time until it matures . stocks create your watchlist and portfolio apple aapl and microsoft msft feature in the top holdings but there are a number of more traditional businesses also in that list including healthcare property business assura agr .l and industrial fastener distributor fastenal fast . the managers invest in three broad categories of investments shares real assets and bonds said cook . the real assets section of the fund is made up of companies listed on the stock market which means most of the fund is usually invested in shares . the focus on income means that returns are often different to peers who have a greater focus on growing capital he added . this makes it a great option to diversify a portfolio of investments over the long term . for those looking to get exposure to bonds in their isa portfolio alex watts senior investment analyst at interactive investor puts forward the invesco sterling bond pdka .l fund as an option . as geopolitical tension a far from-resolved inflationary picture and concerns regarding government spending across developed economies continue or even worsen in government and corporate bond yields remain heightened he said . government bonds sold off globally earlier in march which was sparked by an announcement from the incoming german government of plans to revamp debt rules to boost defence and infrastructure investment in europe s largest economy . this prompted the yields effectively the interest rate return on these investments to rise . read more the highly rated defence stocks investors are buying up the invesco sterling bond fund invests in corporate bonds which is debt issued by a company . the managers look both at the fundamentals underlying an issuing company as well as taking top down view to guide positioning said watts . the fund invests heavily in bonds issued within the financials sector with around % of the portfolio held in bonds issued by banks and insurers then followed by utilities and telecoms . the fund s yield of around .% is attractive and fund manager michael matthew s approach has been well proven with total returns over the long run being impressive versus both peer group and the fund s benchmark . overall when building an investment portfolio interactive investor s jobson emphasised that diversification is key when building an investment portfolio . this means owning a range of different investments across asset classes styles and regions to help reduce risk he said . the impact of freedom and choice pension reforms years on chancellor urged to raise

      "icici bank limited ibn appears an attractive pick as it has been recently upgraded to a zacks rank buy . this upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices . the sole determinant of the zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture . the zacks consensus estimate - the consensus of eps estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock - for the current and following years is tracked by the system . individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by wall street analysts since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time . in these situations the zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements . as such the zacks rating upgrade for icici bank is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price . the change in a company s future earnings potential as reflected in earnings estimate revisions and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated . that s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares . an increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock and institutional investors typically buy or sell it . their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock . fundamentally speaking rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for icici bank imply an improvement in the company s underlying business . investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher . as empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding . here is where the tried and-tested zacks rank stock rating system plays an important role as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions . the zacks rank stock rating system which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups ranging from zacks rank strong buy to zacks rank strong sell has an impressive externally audited track record with zacks rank stocks generating an average annual return of % since . you can see the complete list of today s zacks rank strong buy stocks here . for the fiscal year ending march this company is expected to earn $ . per share which is a change of .% from the year ago reported number . analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for icici bank . over the past three months the zacks consensus estimate for the company has increased .% . unlike the overly optimistic wall street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations the zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of buy and sell ratings for its entire universe of more than stocks at any point in time . irrespective of market conditions only the top % of the zacks covered stocks get a strong buy rating and the next % get a buy rating . so the placement of a stock in the top % of the zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term . you can learn more about the zacks rank here the upgrade of icici bank to a zacks rank positions it in the top % of the zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions implying that the stock might move higher in the near term . want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research today you can download best stocks for the next days . click to get this free report icici bank limited ibn free stock analysis report this article originally published on zacks investment research zacks .com . zacks investment research"

      "globaldata s latest market forecasts illustrate the mixed picture ahead in terms of light vehicle sales by major world region . there s an ongoing price war in china as well as the spectre of trade protectionism and geopolitical issues impacting the sales outlook elsewhere . nevertheless there are significant opportunities or at least potential opportunities out there . we highlight major market trends and opportunities in india s automotive sector . india a market and production hub that is finally showing its potential india has long been viewed as an automotive market with huge demand potential given its vast population and forecasts for economic growth that will bring higher per capita incomes for motorisation in its major conurbations and their regional hinterlands . the indian light vehicle lv market set a new record for the third consecutive year in after having been impacted by the pandemic in - . demonstrating resilience in the face of numerous headwinds including elevated interest rates a depreciating rupee that contributed to higher vehicle prices extreme weather conditions such as heatwaves and uneven monsoons and elections at both the central and state levels the market remained robust . after last year s record sales the indian market is off to a strong start in the new year . the january selling rate surged to an all time high of . million units a year up nearly % from a solid december . in yoy terms sales i .e . wholesales increased by % in january despite a high base . passenger vehicle pv wholesales rebounded in january following the destocking exercise at the end of with each of the top five automakers posting improved figures . the most significant mom growth were observed by suzuki group hyundai and mahindra . according to the federation of automobile dealers associations fada pv inventory levels dropped by around five days to - days in january compared to and days at the end of december and a peak of - days in september . aggressive discounts and incentives at the end of helped clear stocks as well . on the retail side pv sales expanded by a hefty % mom in january but fada cautioned that some of that spike stems from december purchases registered in january for a model year advantage . there s a clear market focus on sub compact cars and also on suvs . in january the new generations of the maruti suzuki swift and dzire as well as the honda amaze all of which are sub compact cars launched in continued to sell well . at the bharat mobility global expo the major new launches were suvs with a particular emphasis on bevs . the biggest highlights included the hyundai creta bev which was launched at the expo and the forthcoming suzuki e vitara . additionally the skoda kylaq and the kia syros suvs have made their market debut . these new models and model updates are expected to support sales this year . a primary driver of india s market has been strong demand for suvs particularly newer and higher end models which often had extended waiting periods . in contrast sales of less expensive entry level models and older suvs lagged as their potential buyers increasingly opted for more affordable used vehicles . another positive factor for vehicle sales this year comes from government policy . the recently announced - union budget included income tax reductions for the middle class which could potentially encourage undecided vehicle buyers to proceed with their purchase decisions in the coming months . the budget also included measures to boost the ev industry such as the exemption of import duties on capital goods crucial to manufacturing ev batteries . on the monetary front the reserve bank of india under the new governor has cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in almost five years from .% to .% despite the fact that a record low rupee is fuelling inflationary pressures . the bank s concern has clearly shifted from inflation to economic growth as the economy continued to slow through to q . further rate cuts are possible and would help consumer spending . let s not forget electric vehicles though . it s an area that looks ripe for growth from current low volumes . india recorded nearly ev sales last year while china achieved million . oems are rapidly evaluating their strategies for india s vehicle market . for example tesla has identified sites for showrooms in new delhi and mumbai marking progress in its strategy to enter india s automotive market . local automakers have resisted tesla s entry fearing it could impact their ev plans . despite ongoing discussions tesla hesitated due to high import duties . recently india reduced its basic customs duty on vehicles priced above $ from % to % . us president donald trump recently highlighted india s high car duties but agreed with modi to pursue an early trade deal to resolve tariff issues . although india s ev sector is smaller than china s it offers tesla an opportunity . an analysis of globaldata s job analytics database reveals that tesla has posted around jobs in february across mumbai and pune reflecting its commitment to building a strong sales service and support network in india . tesla s hiring strategy in india is aimed at driving growth and increasing brand presence in the market . the company is focusing on building a strong service infrastructure improving customer engagement and expanding its market share through targeted marketing strategies . sherla sriprada business fundamentals analyst at globaldata comments these job postings indicate a focus on areas such as charging engineering information technology vehicle service sales customer support operations business support among others . this also indicates plans for possibly more hires and setting up new ev market team in india . india will also become an increasingly important market and production location . suzuki maruti market leader is targeting a local market share of % while also planning to strengthen its vehicle export operations in the country . by fy it aims to have an overall production capacity of four million vehicles a year in india . suzuki has said it aims to launch four new bev models in europe by fy starting with a battery powered vitara with india expected to be the main source of overall vehicles sold in this region . suzuki india has also just introduced its first battery electric vehicle bev the maruti suzuki e vitara marking the company s official foray into the electric vehicle market . maruti suzuki plans to commence production of e vitara vehicle at its gujarat facility in india in spring . vinfast the vietnamese ev maker listed on the nasdaq has also officially entered the indian automotive market with the launch of two all electric suvs the vf and vf at the bharat mobility global expo . the company said it has developed right hand drive versions for the vf and vf suvs specifically for this market . these are the firm s first models to be launched in india . kia corporation has announced that it has begun mass production of its newly developed kia syros small suv in india following the model s official global unveiling earlier this year . kia india held a milestone ceremony at its plant in anantapur in the indian state of andhra pradesh to mark the beginning of syros production an event attended by kia corporation s ceo ho sung song a sure sign of india s growing strategic importance and kia india s managing director gwanggu lee . while many are drawn to india s major cities for sales it is essential not to overlook the less obvious smaller cities and their demand potential . one illustrative example mercedes benz . the premium brand is set to broaden its reach in india by opening an additional dealerships or service outlets in focusing on smaller cities . mercedes benz which currently operates outlets in india is shifting its focus from metropolitan hubs like new delhi and mumbai to towns where demand for high end and electric vehicles surpasses that for entry level models . in indian cities such as kanpur and patna mercedes has observed a higher demand for its premium and electric vehicles . mercedes intends to establish service centres in these areas as an initial step towards expansion . last year the company s sales in the country exceeded vehicles which was a % increase from the previous year . mercedes says it has seen stronger ev sales in smaller cities where stand alone homes offer more charging space than blocks of apartments . hyundai is developing a sub tucson model especially for india . due to be revealed in late and on sale in mid- production of the nii project will take place at the former general motors talagaon plant outside pune . insiders report that there will be up to seven seats with powertrain choices including a hybrid option . light vehicle output in india is forecast by globaldata at around . million units in rising to . million units by . suzuki mahindra tata motors and hyundai dominated the country s vehicle manufacturing volume in below chart but other oems will also undoubtedly look at india s demand potential and low manufacturing costs as presenting very significant opportunities in the years to . major global market trends and opportunities india was originally created and published by just auto a globaldata owned brand . the information on this site
